# Gene Expression Analysis Using R
This project provides an interactive application for Gene Expression Analysis using R. Built with Shiny, the app performs tasks such as identifying differentially expressed genes and visualizing expression patterns from RNA sequencing data.

# Features:
    - Upload RNA Sequence and Metadata: Accepts CSV files for RNA sequences and corresponding metadata.
    - Differential Gene Expression Analysis: Uses DESeq2 to perform analysis on gene expression data.
    - Visualization: Supports heatmaps, Venn diagrams, and interactive plots using pheatmap, VennDiagram, and plotly.
    - Top Genes Viewer: Displays the most highly expressed genes in descending order.
# Requirements:
    Packages
    The following R packages are required to run this project:
    
    shiny
    DESeq2
    pheatmap
    VennDiagram
    plotly
    RColorBrewer

# Upload Data:

Use the RNA Sequence and Metadata file upload inputs to provide your data.
Ensure your files are in CSV format with appropriate formatting for analysis.
# Analyze Data:

Click "Analyze the Differentially Expressed Gene" to initiate differential expression analysis.
Use "Show Top Expression gene in order" to display the top expressed genes.
# Visualization:

View interactive heatmaps, Venn diagrams, and other visual outputs as generated by the app.
# File Structure
Gene_expression_profile.R: Main Shiny app script.
# Example Data Format
Ensure RNA sequence and metadata files are in a structured CSV format suitable for analysis. Refer to the documentation for DESeq2 for specific input requirements.
